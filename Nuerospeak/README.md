"""
Neuroprompting Streamlit Prototype
---------------------------------
Simulates EEG "thought" patterns and translates them into prompts for an LLM (e.g., GPT‑5).

Features
- Press a button to simulate an EEG sample from a small synthetic dataset of "thought intents".
- Visualize the simulated EEG (per‑channel time series + spectrogram‑ish summary).
- Classify the EEG into an intent using a simple nearest‑centroid model.
- Translate the intent into a concrete LLM prompt (text or image generation use cases).
- (Optional) Call OpenAI's API if OPENAI_API_KEY is set; otherwise, display the prompt you'd send.
- Allow uploading your own lightweight EEG feature CSV to replace the synthetic dataset.

Notes
- This is a quick prototype: not medical or BCI‑grade. Replace the classifier with your own model once you have real features.
- EEG here is simulated as 32 channels × 256 timesteps.
